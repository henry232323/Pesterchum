# Pesterchum
Pesterchum-3.6

A version of ghostDunk/illuminatedWax's Pesterchum client, built using Asyncio, PyQt5, and Python 3.6.
A server specific IRC client built to imitate the Pesterchum chat client as seen in Homestuck.

Pictures borrowed from illuminatedWax's version found [here](https://github.com/illuminatedwax/pesterchum)

For more info and theme previews see [Pesterchum-Discord](https://github.com/henry232323/Pesterchum-Discord/blob/master/README.md),
another project by me

### TODO:
- Disconnected blocking dialog / connecting dialog
- Regularize custom themes (Added some support, still needs work)
- Maybe recreate some themes?

# Quirks
Pesterchum-Discord lets you do custom quirks using Regex! (Regular Expression) for help on quirks (they work identically) check out
[illuminatedWax's quirk info](https://github.com/illuminatedwax/pesterchum#quirks-1) on the original Pesterchum. Misspeller has not yet been added. Works similarly to how its documented [here](https://github.com/illuminatedwax/pesterchum/blob/master/PYQUIRKS.mkdn), you do NOT need to add the `function.command = "name"`
